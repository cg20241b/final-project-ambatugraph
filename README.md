# Sunset at Ambatu Island

## Ambatu-what?

Ambatu Island is a small isolated island (an islet, to be precise) located
in North Maluku. Because of the nature of this island, a visit requires
about 15 minutes of travel via small boat from a small port in Pelita Village,
which in itself can only be reached through 1.5 to 2 hours (depending on the
intensity of wave and wind) of travel via longboat from Labuha and an additional
5 hours of flight from Ternate.

Cellular connectivity is hard to reach, a visit from and to this Island is
difficult and time consuming, infrastructure is nowhere near as good as in big
cities, and there are little to no documentation of this Island, even Google Maps
does not recognize where this small island is located! 

There is currently no permanent residence located in this islet. What's interesting,
though, is that even when this island has the surface area equals to approximately
two soccer fields, there used to be inhabitants on this island way back before 1978.
In the present time, they all have moved to Mandioli Island which is a way bigger
Island located across. There, they have access to schools and medical clinics. Some
locals still go to this now-empty island to collect sand and coconut, seaweed farming,
and even gardening.

The water in Ambatu is crystal clear, perfect for snorkeling. Locals are friendly
and they are used to self-sufficient lifestyle by making good use of nature to fulfill
their needs. The view is beautiful, sunset is dazzling, and the full moon at night casts
a calming glow over the island. 


## What's our plan?

Here, we propose to recreate the life and atmosphere of Ambatu Island in a game-like
environment. Well, not accurately, since we have little to no knowledge of how this
Island actually looks like in real life. Here are some features we have in mind as of now:

- **The Island itself,** which is most probably empty, but we're thinking of adding
  vegetations, gazebo, and small huts.
- **Day and Night Cycle,** as this enables us to simulate a beautiful sunset and the
  calming full moon that casts its light to the island through the power of computer graphics.
- **Firework at Night,** this probably goes as the direct opposite of the calming nature of
  rural Ambatu, but we still think that it's a cool effect nonetheless. Plus, we do get to
  practice our particle simulation skills!
- **Water,** because of course, this is an islet, so this would not be complete without water.
  We will probably use fragment shader to achieve this. We'll see.

We also have some other features in mind, but unlikely to implement to the final product,
depending on whether or not we still have time and resource to do so:

- **Life under the sea,** imagine the beauty of coral reefs and sea creatures simulated
  using boids algorithm (yes, the one presented in ACM SIGGRAPH)



## Why?

It's interesting because the name of the Island matches with our team name,
so we thought it would be funny to go with this idea. This environment recreation
type of project also allows us to demonstrate various things required to be present
in a final project (e.g. shader, lighting, and interaction).



## More?

We're also thinking of making a background story of our to-be main character.
Where does he (or she?) comes from? Is he local or perhaps an outsider? A tourist,
or a doctor previously working in big city perhaps? Oh, maybe we go Laskar Pelangi
path and introduce him (or her) as a teacher?

Why is there a firework? Do we have a chance to perhaps make this into a romcom-like
story? We don't know (yet), and we rather worry about the technical sides for now
(no one in our team have previous experience with game engines!) and come back
to this later. 

Got any suggestion? We'll be happy to hear :)
